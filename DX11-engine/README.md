# DX11 Engine Source Code
Source Code for DX11 Engine project.

Interesting Code Examples:

- Terrain.h/.cpp and TerrainEntity.h/.cpp, as well as Helpers.h/.cpp (perlin noise for terrain generation)
- VS_Terrain.hlsl and Noise.hlsli (perlin noise vertex shader)
- MagicMirrorManager and associated shaders, responsible for rendering portals (I call them magic mirrors in here)
- Collider.h/.cpp (early WIP, nothing much here yet)
