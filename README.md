# DirectX11 Engine: About This Project

This is for a project that is currently being developed for a class.
However, I am taking it beyond the scope of this class by making my own additions. Examples include:

- Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise (implemented)
- Physics and Collision (begun, this one is long-term for sure)
- Water rendering (planned)
