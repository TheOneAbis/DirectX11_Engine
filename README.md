# DirectX11 Engine: About This Project

This project was originally developed for a class, but I turned it into a passion project where I can experiment.

Some features in here were not made by me, but by my professor, such as:
- SimpleShader
- DXCore
- OBJ file loading algorithm in Mesh.cpp
- Input

I am also using the ImGUI library for easy UI.

Features I actually did myself:

- Materials and Physically-based Rendering
- Shadows
- Skybox Rendering
- All Shader Programming

Features I'm particularly proud of:

- Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise
- Portal Renderer (this one, especially!!! I wrote my own portal renderer that looks similar to what you might expect in Portal 2)
