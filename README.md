# DirectX11 Engine: About This Project

This is for a project that is currently being developed for a class.

Several features in here were not made by me, but by my professor, such as:
- SimpleShader
- DXCore
- OBJ file loading algorithm in Mesh.cpp
- Input

I am also using the ImGUI library for easy UI.

However, I am taking it beyond the scope of this class by making my own additions. Some examples include:

- Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise (implemented)
- Physics and Collision (begun, this one is long-term for sure)
- Water rendering (planned)
